# IPAS

The Ice Particle and Aggregate Simulator (IPAS) is a theoretical framework that mimics simplified laboratory investigations to perform sensitivity tests, visualize, and better understand growth via collection.  IPAS collects any number of solid hexagonal prisms that are modified to represent plates and columns.  A detailed background description on monomer-monomer (MON-MON) collection in IPAS can be found in [Przybylo (2019)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/76/6/jas-d-18-0187.1.xml?tab_body=abstract-display), bulk testing of which can be found in [Sulia (2020)] (https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-20-0020.1/JAS-D-20-0020.1.xml?rskey=9V3BQD&result=6).

##  Prerequisites

The requirements.txt file lists all Python libraries required to run IPAS in a virtual environment.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Folder Structure


## Deployment

IPAS is typically scaled on a cluster using [dask](https://dask.org/).
